## Development Workflow

### Branching Strategy

- Main branch: `main`
- Development branch: `develop`
- Feature branches: `feature/RWG-123-feature-name`
- Bug fixes: `fix/RWG-123-bug-description`
- Hotfixes: `hotfix/RWG-123-issue-description`

### Commit Guidelines

Follow conventional commits format:
```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Types:
- feat: New feature
- fix: Bug fix
- docs: Documentation
- style: Formatting
- refactor: Code restructuring
- test: Adding tests
- chore: Maintenance

### Pull Request Process

1. Create PR using template
2. Ensure CI checks pass
3. Obtain two approvals
4. Update documentation
5. Squash and merge

## Coding Standards

### Backend Guidelines

- Follow PEP 8
- Document all functions using docstrings
- Maintain >90% test coverage
- Use type hints
- Implement error handling

```python
# Example function structure
def process_word(word: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Process input word and return analysis results.

    Args:
        word (str): Input word to process

    Returns:
        Dict[str, Any]: Analysis results

    Raises:
        ValueError: If word contains invalid characters
    """
    pass
```

### Frontend Guidelines

- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Implement functional components
- Follow React hooks guidelines
- Ensure WCAG 2.1 compliance
- Document components using JSDoc

```typescript
// Example component structure
interface WordDisplayProps {
  word: string;
  definition?: string;
}

const WordDisplay: React.FC<WordDisplayProps> = ({ word, definition }) => {
  // Implementation
};
```

### Testing Requirements

- Unit tests: Jest (Frontend), Pytest (Backend)
- Integration tests: API endpoints
- E2E tests: Cypress
- Performance tests: k6
- Security tests: OWASP guidelines

## CI/CD Pipeline

### GitHub Actions Workflows

```yaml
# Example workflow structure
name: Backend CI
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.11'
      # Additional steps...
```

### Deployment Process

1. Automated deployment to dev environment
2. Manual approval for staging
3. Production deployment via GitOps
4. Automated rollback capability
